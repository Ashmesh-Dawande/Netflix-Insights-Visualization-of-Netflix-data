# Netflix-Insights-Visualization-of-Netflix-data

In this project I created a visualization to reveal insite from the data set.
First I downloaded the netflix data from kaggle.The data file which is downloaded is netflix_titles.csv 
Then I created a notebook file in jupyter notebook to clean some data or add some. I read the data using pandas library and then added two new columns which consist of month and the year when they were added on netflix. Also converted the float values in integer. Then created a new csv file Netflix.csv which contains the changes done the inital data set.
Then I used tableau to plot the graphs and collect the insights from the graphs.
I have given all the things in the folder which includes two csv files , one tableau notebook , a notebook file and a dashboard image in png format.



## Insights From the Dashboard
1. From the first graph that is line we came to know that movies are more popular than tv shows. The blue line denotes Movies and Yellow denotes Tv show. There is a decrease in the in movies and tv shows being added in 2020 and 2021. I think its because of pandemic.
2. Also from the rating graph we would notice that the people from all over the world tends to like shows and movies which are for mature audience only. Also tv-14 is not that behind.
3.People likes to watch movies and shows which have that spicy drama. And suprisingly they also do like documentaries.
4. From the map we will see that USA makes more content that anywhere around the world.Also we can see some countries which are depicted in black color this means that that country's movie or tv show is not on netflix.


## conclusion from my side
If you want to produce a (movie/tv show) or you want it on netflix so as it recommanded that it should be a drama movie with mature content. And if you are producing it in america with american crew it will have the highest chance of becoming a popular one netflix.
